			When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles, which <br>the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a <br>shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a "kick" that will be used <br>to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur <br>simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time which proceeds much faster in each <br>successive level. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked <br>by armed projections from Fischer's subconscious, which has been trained to defend against extraction. The team takes <br>Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito <br>up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into "limbo", a <br>world of infinite subconscious from which escape is difficult and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. <br>Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.
