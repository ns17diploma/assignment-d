			In town he barters with a store owner, the Engineer (Tom Waits), to recharge the battery of his portable music player. <br>While waiting, he goes across the street to the town bar, where a gang of bikers attack, but he quickly kills them all. <br>Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, making it clear that the offer is <br>non-negotiable. After Carnegie's blind mistress Claudia (Jennifer Beals) gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders <br>Claudia's daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) to seduce Eli, but he turns her down. While killing time, she finds his book. <br>Unperturbed, Eli offers to share his food with her, and before they eat, he says grace. The following day, Solara repeats <br>the prayer, but Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara's words relate to the book he has been seeking. He soon <br>forces Solara to tell him if Eli was reading a book, and realizes Eli's book is the one he wantsâ€”a Bible.
