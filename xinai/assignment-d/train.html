		<div class="plot">
			As the train departs, a convulsing young woman boards with a bite wound on her leg. She becomes a zombie and attacks a <br>train attendant, quickly spreading infection in the train. Seok-woo receives a call from his co-worker warning him that <br>"violent riots" have erupted in Korea. Cheerleader Jin-hee, her crush baseball player Yong-guk, and several passengers <br>manage to escape to an uninfected car. Sang-hwa tries to barricade the door, then realizes the zombies can't open it and <br>merely charge at the sight of humans. Seong-kyeong uses water and newspaper to cover up the windows, which tricks the <br>zombies into thinking the uninfected passengers are not there. News broadcasts report zombie outbreaks throughout the <br>country. The locomotive engineer alerts everyone over the intercom that the train will not go to Cheonan, but will stop <br>at Daejeon Station, where all passengers will be quarantined. Seok-woo calls his co-worker to arrange that he and his <br> daughter not be quarantined. When the train stops at Daejeon, the rest of the passengers head to the main exit, but <br>Seok-woo, Soo-an, and the homeless man head to a different hall. However, the passengers discover all soldiers and police <br>in the station have been infected. In the ensuing chaos, the group is separated. Soo-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the <br>homeless man reach a car in the center of the train and barricade themselves in a bathroom. The locomotive engineer <br>restarts the train to head to Busan, where a successful quarantine zone has reportedly been established. Seok-woo, <br>Sang-hwa, and Yong-guk barely manage to board one of the rear cars as the train departs the station.
