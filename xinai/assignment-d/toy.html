			Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour of the seemingly idyllic play-setting by <br>Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return to Andy, <br>but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She takes Woody home and plays with him along with her <br>other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers plays roughly with Andy's toys. Buzz <br>seeks out Lotso to request to have them moved to the older children's room, but Lotso refuses. At the same time, Mrs. <br>Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before <br>they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode (which <br>caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, a toy clown <br> named Chuckles explains to Woody that he, Lotso and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were <br>accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, they made their way back to her house, only to find that <br>Lotso had been replaced.
