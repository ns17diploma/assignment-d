			The starship Avalon is transporting 5,000 colonists and 258 crew members, in hibernation pods, to the planet Homestead II, <br> a journey taking 120 years. Thirty years into its journey, the ship passes through an asteroid field, which causes a <br>malfunction. The malfunction awakens one passenger, mechanical engineer Jim Preston, 90 years early. <br>
			After a year of isolation, with no company except Arthur, an android bartender, Jim grows despondent and contemplates <br>suicide. One day, he notices Aurora Lane in her pod. Her video profile reveals she is a writer with a humorous <br>personality. After struggling with the morality of manually reviving Aurora for companionship, he awakens her, claiming <br>her pod also must have malfunctioned. Jim makes Arthur promise not to tell Aurora why she really woke up. Aurora is <br>devastated that she will grow old and die before the ship reaches Homestead II. Her research for a way to re-enter <br>hibernation is fruitless. Eventually, she accepts her situation and begins writing a book about her experiences. Jim and <br>Aurora grow closer, eventually falling in love.
