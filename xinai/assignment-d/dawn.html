		<div class="plot">
			Luthor kidnaps Lois and Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother, to bring Superman out of exile. He reveals to him that he <br>manipulated Superman and Batman by fueling their distrust for each other. Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in <br>exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman fights Superman and <br>eventually subdues him. Before Batman can kill him with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "save Martha", whose name is <br>also shared with Bruce's late mother, confusing him long enough for Lois to arrive and reason with Batman. Realizing <br>how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the <br>scout ship.
