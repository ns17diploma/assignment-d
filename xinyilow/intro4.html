				College student Beca (Anna Kendrick) knows she does not want to be part of a clique,<br> but that's exactly where she finds herself after arriving at her new school. <br>Thrust in among mean gals, nice gals and just plain weird gals,<br> Beca finds that the only thing they have in common is how well they sing together.<br> She takes the women of the group out of their comfort zone of traditional arrangements and into a <br>world of amazing harmonic combinations in a fight to the top of college music competitions.
