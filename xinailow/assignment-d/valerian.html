			Valerian and Laureline venture further into the infected area, realizing that it is not actually radioactive, and reach a <br>large, shielded hall where they find the humanoids holding Filitt. Their leader explains that his people were living <br>peacefully on the planet Mül when two technologically advanced races, one of them human, fought a war in space above Mül. <br> The human commander, revealed to be Filitt, ordered the firing of a doomsday weapon, over the protests of his <br>subordinates. That weapon destroyed the enemy, but also Mül. A small group of survivors sheltered in a crashed spaceship <br>and managed to repair it, learning much about technology and the history of other races in the process. They eventually <br>came to Alpha, where they assimilated more knowledge and constructed a spaceship that could recreate their former <br>home. The hall they are standing in is that spaceship, and they have kidnapped Filitt in order to obtain the converter <br>and the pearl they need to launch the ship. Filitt admits to his role in the genocide, but argues that the cover-up was <br>necessary to prevent the human race from being expelled from Alpha.
