			The next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, <br> Dalton is introduced to Lionel "Elvis" Cormac (Willem Dafoe), another human, but is interrupted when a military team <br>arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey, however, Audrey manages to <br>knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac reveals that he was once a vampire. He was cured <br>when a car crash ejected him from his sun-proof vehicle. Because of his exposure to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, <br>but his life was saved when he landed in the river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn <br>him human again. Dalton agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.
