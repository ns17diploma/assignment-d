			In New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment because of various health and physical <br>problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend, Sgt. James "Bucky" Barnes, Rogers again <br>attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine <br>allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a "super-soldier" experiment <br>under Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips, and British agent Peggy Carter. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that <br>Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. <br>The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure <br>and suffered permanent side-effects.
