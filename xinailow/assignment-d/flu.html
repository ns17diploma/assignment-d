			The movie then cuts to a rescue operation conducted by the Budang ERT (Emergency Response Team), who are attempting to <br>rescue a woman who drove her car into an open shaft. One of the members, Kang Jigu rappels into the shaft and manages to <br>rescue the woman, Dr. Kim In-hae, moments before the car falls to the bottom of the shaft. Despite having saved her <br>life, In-hae was ungrateful towards Jigu, claiming that he was bragging when it was simply his job to rescue her. He later <br>admits to his co-worker Bae Kyung-ub that he found In-hae attractive. He is then told by the station chief that In-hae <br>has called him. Later on that night, Jigu met with In-hae, who tries to persuade him to go back into the hole to <br>retrieve her handbag, as it contained a substantial amount of data. After Jigu pointed out that the hole had been sealed, <br>and refusing to do the job for money, In-hae attempts to go down into the hole, but scrapes her knee tripping over a <br>barrier. After Jigu attempted to comfort her, she stormed off.
