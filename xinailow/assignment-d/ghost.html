			A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives <br>Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. The team successfully thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business <br>conference, and Killian destroys a rogue mechanical geisha after it murders a hostage. Killian, who has been experiencing <br>hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as glitches, is becoming increasingly bothered by how little she remembers about <br>her past. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity, known only as Kuze, Killian breaks protocol <br>and "dives" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. Using <br>the information she was able to gather, the two trace the hacker to a Yakuza nightclub, where they are lured into a <br>trap. The resulting explosion destroys Batou's eyes, and leaves Killian's body severely damaged. Cutter is enraged by <br>Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line.
