			Hoo Joon is a Korean Hallyu star working in Shanghai, China. Fang Miao Miao is a jobbing entertainment reporter working <br>for a magazine. By chance Miao Miao catches Hoo Joon meeting fellow Hallyu star Ai Lin at a nightclub and photographs the <br> two in what appears to be a romantic encounter. Since Ai Lin is dating a third star, Gao Xiang, who is a friend and <br>colleague of Hoo Joon, publication of the photographs would lead to reputational damage to both Hoo Joon and Ai Lin. <br>Hoo Joon catches Miao Miao in the act seizes her cellphone and destroys it. Contracted, as a spokesman, performer and <br>personality to a Chinese conglomerate, Hoo Joon's management sets out to discredit and silence Miao Miao, and she is fired <br>from her job.
