			The Boss Baby apologizes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp, a place where infants <br>with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. The Boss Baby explains that he was sent to see why puppies <br>are getting more love than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which <br>is unleashing a new puppy on the day that employees take their children to work. The Boss Baby stays intelligent by <br>drinking a "Secret Baby Formula" that enables a baby to act like an adult. However, if a baby does not drink it after a <br>period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threaten to fire him for not <br>bringing in information, thereby stranding him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to keep that from <br>happening.
